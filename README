FLAPPY BIRDS - Aniruddha Das

An adaptation of the popular game: Flappy Birds

START SCREEN

Upon starting you will be directed to a home screen.
Pressing A on this screen takes you to the game.

GAMEPLAY

A and the UP button can be used to stay airborne.

The B button can be pressed at any time during gameplay
 to pause the game.

The RIGHT and LEFT buttons can be used to add an x-component
 to the direction of motion of the bird.

 At any point of time the SELECT button takes you back to the
  start screen.

Upon colliding with the pipes or hitting the ground, the 
game ends.

For every pipe crossed, the score is incremented.

For every 8 points scored, the gap between the 2 pipes is 
reduced by 3 pixels. However, the gap between the pipes can
 never be less than 30.

 Similary, if the player crosses 32, the speed of the pipes 
coming towards the player increases.

These make the game progressively harder to play. 

Once you crash or go out of bounds, you are given a choice between
 pressing R + L to go back to the start screen. Again, SELECT works
  too.

Pressing any other button opens up an end screen. 

END SCREEN

The End Screen displays your score and has an image drawn in the bottom-
right corner. This image corresponds to the players score and is my 
adaptation of the medals that Flappy Birds used to have.

The Bird that is face down is displayed when score < 5
The Bird looking slightly up is displayed when the score is >= 5 and <= 15
The Cool Bird is displayed in any other cases.

At the end screen, SELECT can be pressed to restart.
